Rainbow Bridge Library Presentation for ETH Denver
==================================================

**Ethereum & NEAR, sitting in a tree, _B U I DL I N G_**

Getting audience feedback to put some finishing touches on the Rainbow Bridge client library

The slides, contained in `index.html`, are built using [remarkjs](https://github.com/gnab/remark), which allows you to write your slides in nice simple markdown and turns them into beautiful, browser-powered slides complete with speaker notes. Read its readme to find out more about it.

There's lots of custom styling on the slides, found at the top of the `index.html` file.


Talk Description
================

If you could add cross-chain functionality to your app with only six imports and four easy steps, would you do it?

You could use ERC20 tokens in NEAR, where block times are fast and transaction fees are cheap.

You could let users make NFTs in NEAR, then send them to Ethereum to list them in larger marketplaces.

You could let users balance liquidity and arbitrage across markets on both chains.

This talk will demo the soon-to-be-released Rainbow Bridge UI maintained by NEAR, an app focused on just sending raw assets from one chain to the other. Then it will give a high-level overview of how the Rainbow Bridge works, introducing some key concepts and terms. That will give us the foundation we need to explore how to add Rainbow Bridge functionality to your own app, using the soon-to-be-released Rainbow Bridge Library.

And that's where we need your help! This library isn't released yet, and we'd love your input. First question: what should we call it? This talk will have several polls, asking for your feedback to help us cross the finish line to our 1.0 release.
